# Shop App

## GETTING THE CODE
The simplest way to obtain the code is using the github .zip feature. Click [here](https://github.com/alaa-shahin/shop-app.git) to get the latest stable code as a .zip file, then unzip it to wherever you want.

The more complicated and easier to update method is using git. You'll need to download/setup git or some other client. When installed, open a terminal and visit the directory where you unzipped the source code and type in:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/alaa-shahin/meal.git
```
